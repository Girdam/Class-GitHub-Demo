## Relationship of SES to Math Scores

This section will look at the relationship of socioeconomic status to math scores.
I will begin with summary of the math scores. 

```{r}
hsb2 %>%
  group_by(ses) %>%
  summarize(mean(math), median(math), sd(math), min(math), max(math))
  
```

## Now let's look at a plot

```{r}
hsb2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ses, math)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
